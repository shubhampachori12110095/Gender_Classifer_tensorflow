# How to Train from Scratch

*WARNING:* Training an Inception v3 network from scratch is a computationally intensive task and depending on your compute setup may take several days or even weeks.

here we just talk about train a task on one GPU, later in future I will write how to train using mutiple GPUs. 

The training speed is dictated by many factors -- most importantly the batch size and the learning rate schedule. Both of these parameters are heavily coupled to the hardware set up.
