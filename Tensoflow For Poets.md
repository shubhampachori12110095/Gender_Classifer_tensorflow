run TensorFlow on a single machine, and will train a simple classifier to classify images of flowers.

We will be using transfer learning, which means we are starting with a model that has been already trained on another problem. We will then be retraining it on a similar problem. Deep learning from scratch can take days, but transfer learning can be done in short order.

We are going to use a model trained on the ImageNet Large Visual Recognition Challenge dataset. These models can differentiate between 1,000 different classes, like Dalmatian or dishwasher. You will have a choice of model architectures, so you can determine the right tradeoff between speed, size and accuracy for your problem.
